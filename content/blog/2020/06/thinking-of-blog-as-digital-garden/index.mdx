title: "Thinking of this blog as a Digital Garden"
date: "2020-07-02"
description: Digital Garden is a relatively new term which describes a different standpoint on what a blog is. Instead of posting finished and polished pieces, Digital Garden is about focusing more on the process behind it, a relaxed, more "human" endeavour.

![Digital Garden](post-18-5.png)

I recently stumbled upon <ExtLink link={"https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden"}>this article by Joel Hooks</ExtLink> on HN explaining the concept of a Digital Garden.

> It is a blog, sure, but it is also a spot where I can post ideas, snippets, resources, thoughts, collections, and other bits and pieces that I find interesting and useful. Instead of always being a “performance” level of blogging, it can be a looser more human endeavor that drops the idea of robots sorting the content and embraces the idea of curation, by me, for you.
> <span>Joel Hooks</span>

This analogy is perfect. In a real garden, you plant seeds, water them, and take care of them for the fulfillment and satisfaction that they bring onto you/give you. These plants yield fruits, of course, but the feeling of contentment while watching them grow is very rewarding.

Even though I call my site a "blog", it just refers to the reverse chronological ordering of the homepage list of posts. It's not about putting out polished, heavily edited 5,000-word "showpieces", it's a place for writing small, personal posts about things that interest me, things that I'm interested in, a place where I grow myself.

Thinking about the blog in this way removes the pressure to be perfect, the worry about what others will think about a post, I just write what I want to write. Most of the things I publish here are how-to instructions on how I fixed a bug, or how I developed a particular feature or notes on the things I learned. It also opens up the possibilities to add many more things on the website, I look forward to exploring more about this idea.
